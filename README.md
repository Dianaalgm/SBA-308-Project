SBA 308- A script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result for assignments. 
Notes/Thoughts:
On my first try I used the example given but I added extra variables and objects that weren't needed. I had to reread the instructions and I realized I had to delete everything
and use the example without changing anything. I tried to do ask much as I could before the due date but I will be coming back to this assignment to finish it and be able to 
console log with out getting undefined and errors.
